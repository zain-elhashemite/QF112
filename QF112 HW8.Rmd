# Question 1 (Adapted from Stinerock)

For this problem and all the others in this homework assignment, you are not allowed to use any of the pre-built linear regression commands such as lm() unless specifically instructed to.  Using the "mtcars" data set in R (a pre-loaded data frame)
```{r}
#?mtcars  #make sure you comment this out when you knit it as this makes knitting weird
```
For this problem, we're going to look at the relationship between "mtcars\$qsec", its quarter mile time and "mtcars\$hp", its gross horsepower.  We'll be using the gross horsepower as the independent variable.

## a)

Create a scatterplot of these two variables

```{r}

data("mtcars")

x = c(mtcars$hp)
y = c(mtcars$qsec)

plot(x,y, main = "Scatterplot of HP vs Quartermile Time", xlab = "HP", ylab = "Q-Mile Time (Seconds)")

```


## b)

Estimate the parameters for the regression line between these two variables

```{r}

x = c(mtcars$hp)
y = c(mtcars$qsec)

beta1 = cov(x, y) / var(x)
beta0 = mean(y) - beta1 * mean(x)

#beta1: -0.01845831
#beta0: 20.55635


```

## c)

For this fit, what is your R-squared value?

```{r}
yhat = beta0 + beta1 * x

rss = sum((y - yhat)^2)

tss = sum((y - mean(y))^2)

r_squared = 1 - (rss/tss)

#r_squared: 0.5015804


```

## d)

Is this fit significant at the alpha=.05 level?

```{r}
#Ho: Beta1 = 0
#Ha: Beta1 =/ 0

n = length(x)
rse = sqrt(sum((y-yhat)^2)/(n-2))
std_err = rse/sqrt(sum((x-mean(x))^2))
p = 2*(1-pt(abs(beta1/std_err),n-2))
p

#since the p-value is less than our alpha of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis concluding that x and y are linearly related

```

## e)

What is the p-value?
```{r}

p = 2*(1-pt(abs(beta1/std_err),n-2))
p

#p-value = 5.766253e-06

```


# Question 2

Using your data set of the two assets that we've been using this semester, perform the following operations.

## a)

Choose one of your variables to be the independent and one to be the dependent variables.  Create a second data frame that just consists of the first 6 months of data for both.  Using just this first six months, find the estimates for the linear relationship between these two assets.


```{r}
library(quantmod)
getSymbols("AAPL;ADP", from="2022-01-01", to="2022-07-01")

data = data.frame(as.numeric(AAPL$AAPL.Adjusted),as.numeric(ADP$ADP.Adjusted))

x = as.numeric(AAPL$AAPL.Adjusted)
y = as.numeric(ADP$ADP.Adjusted)
meanAAPL = mean(AAPL$AAPL.Adjusted)
meanADP = mean(ADP$ADP.Adjusted)

beta1 = sum((x-meanAAPL)*(y-meanADP))/(sum((x-meanAAPL)^2))
beta0 = meanADP - beta1 * meanAAPL
yhat = beta0 + beta1 * x


#parameter estimates
#beta_1: 0.3102956
#beta_0: 162.8703
yhat

plot(x,y, xlab = "AAPL", ylab = "ADP")
abline(beta0, beta1, col = "red")


```

## b)

Determine the R-squared value and determine the p-value for this fit.
```{r}

rss = sum((y - yhat)^2)
tss = sum((y - mean(y))^2)

r_sq = 1 - rss/tss
#r_squared value: 0.1223301


df = length(x) - 2
rse = sqrt(rss/df)
t_stat = beta1 / (rse/sqrt(sum((x-meanAAPL)^2)))

pval = 2 * pt(-abs(t_stat), df)
#pval:6.839496e-05




```


## c)

Using the model that you determined in part a), for the latter six months of data, use the linear regression model to predict the dependent asset using the independent one.  Using these predictions (and of course the actual observed values of the dependent asset over this time period) calculate the R-squared.  How does this compare with the value you found in part b)?  If they are different, why might that be?

```{r}
library(quantmod)
getSymbols("AAPL;ADP", from="2022-07-01", to="2023-01-01")
data = data.frame(as.numeric(AAPL$AAPL.Adjusted),as.numeric(ADP$ADP.Adjusted))

x = as.numeric(AAPL$AAPL.Adjusted)
y = as.numeric(ADP$ADP.Adjusted)
meanAAPL = mean(AAPL$AAPL.Adjusted)
meanADP = mean(ADP$ADP.Adjusted)

beta1 = sum((x-meanAAPL)*(y-meanADP))/(sum((x-meanAAPL)^2))
beta0 = meanADP - beta1 * meanAAPL
yhat = beta0 + beta1 * x

plot(x,y, xlab = "AAPL", ylab = "ADP")
abline(beta0, beta1, col = "red")


rss = sum((y-yhat)^2)
tss = sum((y-meanADP)^2)
R2 = 1 - (rss/tss)
R2

df = length(x) - 2
rse = sqrt(rss/df)
t_stat = beta1 / (rse/sqrt(sum((x-meanAAPL)^2)))

p2 = 2 * pt(-abs(t_stat), df)
p2
#pvalue = 0.004579247
```
